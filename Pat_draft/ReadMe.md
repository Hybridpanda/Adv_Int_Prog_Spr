this folder is just pat trying out a different way to set up the application.
I will be making two seperate folders to seperate the front end and back end.

things to do:
set up two seperate backends
-one to handle the page loading
-and the other one to handle the requests
--this I hope doesnt make it hard, something like liveserver

there would need to be multiple pages.
-a login page
-a setup user page
-a home page
-a leaderboard page (we might have it where the home page has both a search function and a leaderboard)
-a favor page -- this will have functionality of adding a favor and deleting a favor, and will show owed and owing, and the completed favors.
-a requests page -- this will show a users active requests to be done, the ones they have made or apart of, and the completed requests. functions will incude being able to add requests or remove their reward, and if there is no reward the request will remove off the page and be gone from the home page.

I dont know how to implement how much in a list atm.
